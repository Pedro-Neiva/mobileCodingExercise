- Multitask (on devices that support this feature)
- Works on any orientation because was implemented with CollectionView instead of TableView
- Responsive
- Solid MVC architecture
- Unit testing in all model and controller classes
- Save images into cache, reducing mobile data and batery usage

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Swift 4.0+

## Installation

To reduce coupling, this solution keeps external libraries to a minimum using only:

* AlamoFire: an HTTP networking library used to perform HTTP requests.
* OHHTTPStubs: a library designed to stub network requests and improve unit testing. 

This app uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) as dependency manager. After downloading all project files you should perform the following command on the same directory.

	pod install
